To use the tool use Open to open the MusicList.jsfb (this is usually found in the Audio section of bakedfile01.cak)

The tool will show you how many slots are used, which can be paged up and down. You can also search by the slot name (where known) or the internal ID

The only editable field is the Cue Point - this is where the music is recued by the engine (when looping, or when used as a victory/Royal Rumble theme).

The data is stored to one decimal point, and is in seconds.

When done, save the file out, place it in an Audio folder as MusicList.jsfb and bake like any other.

It is unknown how closely the internal IDs match those in the audio WEM files, they matched in 2k22, but the format here is different.
