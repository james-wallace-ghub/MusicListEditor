To use the tool use Open to open the MusicList.jsfb (this is usually found in the Audio section of bakedfile01.cak)

The tool will show you how many slots are used, which can be paged up and down. You can also search by the slot name (where known) or the internal ID

The only editable field is the Cue Point - this is where the music is recued by the engine (when looping, or when used as a victory/Royal Rumble theme).

The data is stored to one decimal point, and is in seconds.

When done, save the file out, place it in an Audio folder as MusicList.jsfb and bake like any other.

It is unknown how closely the internal IDs match those in the audio WEM files, they matched in 2k22, but the format here is different.

To add slots to the end of the list, use the Add slot button, to remove the last slot, use that appropriate button. Names (both internal and Suite strings) can be altered by retyping them in the text boxes, and the slot ID can also be altered. Note that newly created slots will be given by default an ID equivalent to their position in the file, which is not necessarily a valid value.
